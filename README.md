# jekyll-slugify-categories

Misteriously, [Jekyll doesn't slugify
categories](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5813), so when posts
permalinks include them and they contain spaces, you end up with spaces
in your URL.

This plugin is a drop in replacement ("monkey patch") for the culprit
Jekyll method to fix that.  No configuration required!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jekyll-slugify-categories'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-slugify-categories

## Usage

NADA :D

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install
dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run
`bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to
experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake
install`. To release a new version, update the version number in
`version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create
a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the
`.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
